# Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines

# About the Project
The "Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines" project aims to predict whether a stock's price will increase (1) or remain constant/decrease (0) based on news headlines. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze headlines and make predictions using machine learning algorithms.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can analyze historical news headlines related to specific stocks and forecast the stock price movement for the next trading day. The model will categorize the headlines into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and based on this sentiment analysis, predict whether the stock price will go up (1) or down/remain constant (0).

<strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong> The project starts by acquiring historical news headlines and corresponding stock price labels from a given dataset in CSV format. The data is preprocessed to handle any missing information and cleaned to remove non-alphabetic characters and unnecessary features.

<strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> The headlines are transformed into numerical features using the bag-of-words technique. The text data is converted into a matrix of token counts using a CountVectorizer, which is essential for input to the machine learning model.

<strong>Model Building and Evaluation:</strong> Two machine learning models are implemented for comparison: Random Forest classifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The models are trained on the processed data to learn patterns and relationships between news headlines and stock price movements. The performance of each model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
