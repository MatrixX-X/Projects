<strong>About:</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback UI project is a web application that allows users to submit feedback about a product or service. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and involves creating a simple user interface that allows the user to enter their feedback and submit it to the system.

The HTML code will include a basic structure of the web page, such as a header, main content area, and footer. Within the main content area, we will include a form that the user can fill out with their feedback.

In the CSS code, we will style the web page to make it look more appealing and user-friendly. We can add styles to the header, main content area, and footer to create a cohesive design.

In the JavaScript code, we will create a function that is triggered when the user clicks the submit button.
