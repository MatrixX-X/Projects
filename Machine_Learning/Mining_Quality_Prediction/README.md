# Project: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Mining Industry

# About the Project
Mining companies are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to improve their operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making. This project focuses on exploring various applications where mining companies can leverage the power of AI and ML to revolutionize their processes and achieve better results. The project uses four different algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the quality of ore based on various input features.

# Project Tasks
## Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and Business Case
In this task, we define the project's scope and discuss the importance of AI and ML in the mining industry. We also outline the specific applications we will explore throughout the project.

## Task #2: Import Libraries/Datasets and Perform Data Exploration
This task involves loading the mining dataset, inspecting its structure and datatypes, and checking for missing values. We also perform data exploration to gain insights into the dataset.

## Task #3: Perform Data Visualization
Data visualization helps us understand the relationships and correlations between different features in the mining dataset. We use various plots and graphs to visualize the data and identify any patterns.

## Task #4: Prepare the Data Before Model Training
Data preparation is a critical step before training the models. We preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and scale the features to ensure optimal performance of the models.

## Task #5: Train and Evaluate a Linear Regression Model
We start by training a linear regression model to predict the percentage of silica concentrate in the mining dataset. We evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.

## Task #6: Train and Evaluate Decision Tree and Random Forest Models
Next, we explore decision tree and random forest models, which are powerful algorithms for regression tasks. We train and evaluate these models to compare their performance with the linear regression model.

## Task #7: Train an Artificial Neural Network for Regression
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are popular for complex tasks. We build an ANN model to predict the percentage of silica concentrate and assess its accuracy.

## Task #8: Compare Models and Calculate Regression KPIs
In this final task, we compare the performance of all the models trained in previous tasks. We calculate various regression Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared. These KPIs will help us identify the best-performing model for the given mining dataset.
