<strong>About:</strong><br/>
	The Blue Bank loan analysis project is a data analysis project focused on analyzing the loan application data of Blue Bank, a fictional bank. The project aims to analyze the data and uncover insights and patterns that can help the bank make better lending decisions.

	To perform this analysis, Python and Tableau will be used. Python will be used for data cleaning, manipulation, and preparation, while Tableau will be used for data visualization.

	The project involves analyzing a large dataset containing information about borrowers, including financial history, and credit score. The dataset also includes information about the loan, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term.

The following steps will be followed in the project:

<strong>Data Collection:</strong> The loan data will be collected from the Blue Bank's database.

<strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> The data will be cleaned to remove duplicates, missing values, and other errors. Python's Pandas library will be used for this task.

<strong>Data Preparation:</strong> The cleaned data will be transformed and prepared for analysis. This step may include feature engineering, normalization, and data aggregation.

<strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> The data will be explored using statistical and visual methods to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries will be used for this task.

<strong>Data Visualization:</strong> The results of the analysis will be visualized using Tableau. The visualizations will help to communicate the insights and findings to stakeholders.

Some specific tasks that can be performed in the Blue Bank Loan Analysis project include:

Identifying the loan approval rate for different demographics such as gender, age, and income.
Examining the relationship between credit score and loan approval rate.
Analyzing the loan repayment behavior of borrowers.

Overall, the Blue Bank Loan Analysis project will provide valuable insights to the bank, which can help it to optimize its lending practices and increase profitability.
