<strong>About:</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales analysis is the process of examining sales data to identify patterns, trends, opportunities and challenges for a business. It can help improve sales performance, optimize marketing strategies, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, and inform business decisions.

For value Inc project, we used Python and Tableau to perform sales analysis on a dataset of retail transactions. We used Python to clean, transform and explore the data using libraries such as Numpy and Pandas. We used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that shows key metrics such as markup percentage, profits by county, client type, client age and costs. The dashboard also allows filtering and slicing by different dimensions to gain deeper insights into the sales performance of value Inc.

The goal of this project was to provide value Inc with a comprehensive and user-friendly tool to monitor and improve their sales operations.
